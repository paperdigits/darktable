        <p> The filmstrip along the bottom shows the same images as lighttable filemanager, with
            respect to filters and sort order. It is turned on/off with key accelerator
                <i>Ctrl+F</i>. You can navigate along the filmstrip by scrolling with the mouse
            wheel. The filmstrip allows you to interact with images while you are not in lighttable
            filemanager mode. For example, you can, while developing an image in darkroom mode,
            switch to another image to develop, by double clicking the thumbnail in the filmstrip.
            You can also rate the images as you do in lighttable, copy/paste history stack, etc. </p>
