    <title>Exporting images</title>
    <body>
        <p> Changes to an image are not saved as in a regular image editor. darktable is a
            non-destructive editor, which means all changes are stored in a database, and the
            original image is untouched. Therefore, you need to export images to bake the processing
            options into an output file that can be distributed outside of darktable. </p>
        <p> Images are exported from the lighttable view, using the <i>export selected</i> dialog in
            the right panel (<xref href="../lighttable/lighttable.dita#export_selected"/>). In
            general, export means: save my developed raw image as a JPEG. </p>
        <p> The export is modularized into <i>storage</i> and <i>format</i>. darktable ships with
            several storage modules such as <i>save on disk</i>, various webalbums, a LaTeX photo
            book template and more. Format modules are the actual image formats such as JPEG, PNG,
            TIFF, OpenEXR and more. </p>
        <p> Select images on the lighttable, choose the target storage and format, and set the
            maximum width and height image restraints. This means that none of the images will be
            bigger than any of the width/height restraints and hit the export button. Leave the
            width and height restraints at zero if you want the original resolution. </p>
