            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p> This section will guide you through the basics of developing an image in the
                darkroom view. </p>
            <p> To begin, open an image in darkroom mode by double clicking an image thumbnail on
                the lighttable. The darkroom mode is where the actual adjustments for an image are
                made, where an arsenal of modules are at hand to help you reach your goal. </p>
            <p> Each change made on a module while developing an image is turned into a <xref
                    href="history"><i>history stack</i></xref> item. The history is stored in a
                database and in an XMP sidecar file for the specific image. </p>
            <p> All changes are stored automatically when you switch images or go from one darktable
                view to another. You can safely leave darkroom mode or quit darktable at any time
                and come back later to continue your work. That said darktable does not need a
                    <q>save</q> button and it does not have one. <indexterm>
                    <primary>save button</primary>
                </indexterm>
            </p>
            <p> On the left panel in darkroom mode is the <xref href="history"><i>history
                        stack</i></xref>, showing changes starting from bottom, and building up with
                each change made to the image. You can select a point in this history to show how
                the image looked at that point, for comparison of changes. The stack can be
                compressed: it will be optimized and redundant changes will be discarded. When you
                think you are done and are happy with what you have done, just compress the history
                stack. </p>
            <p> darktable ships with a number of modules, arranged into groups. These module groups
                are accessed via toggle buttons in the right panel, just under the histogram. There
                are also two special module groups named <q>active</q> and <q>favorites</q>, which
                only show modules enabled in the history for the current image, and modules selected
                as a favorite, respectively. Marking a module as a favorite is done in the <i>more
                    modules</i> dialog (<xref href="more_modules"/>), at the bottom of the right
                panel, by clicking a module until a star is displayed in front of the icon. </p>

        <section id="basic_development_steps_wb">
            <title>White balance</title>
            <p> The <xref href="whitebalance"><i>white balance</i></xref> module controls the
                white balance or color temperature of the image. It's always enabled and reads its
                default values from camera metadata embedded in the image. The most common change is
                fine-tuning the white balance, which is done using the <q>temperature</q> slider.
                Moving this slider left will make the color balance cooler, and moving it right will
                make it warmer. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="basic_development_steps_exposure">
            <title>Exposure correction</title>
            <p> The <xref href="exposure"><i>exposure</i></xref> module is probably the most
                basic module of them all. Exposure is fine-tuned either by using the slider, or by
                dragging with the mouse in the <xref href="histogram"><i>histogram</i></xref>.
                You can also boost the black level to enhance contrast; but be careful: use small
                amounts, like steps of 0.005. There is also an auto-correct feature. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="basic_development_steps_noise">
            <title>Noise reduction</title>
            <p> The best starting point for noise reduction is <xref href="denoise_profiled"
                        ><i>profiled denoise</i></xref>. This module offers an almost
                    <q>single-click</q> solution to fight noise. From a user perspective the effect
                only depends on camera type and ISO value, both derived from Exif data. All other
                settings are taken from a database of noise profiles that the darktable team has
                collected, now covering well above 200 popular camera models. In addition you have
                several other options in darktable to reduce noise. There is <xref
                    href="raw_denoise"><i>raw denoise</i></xref>, <xref
                    href="denoise_bilateral"><i>denoising based on bilateral filter</i></xref>,
                    <xref href="denoise_non_local_means"><i>denoising based on non-local
                        means</i></xref>, and <xref href="equalizer"><i>equalizer</i></xref>,
                which is based on wavelets. If your camera is not yet supported by <xref
                    href="denoise_profiled"><i>profiled denoise</i></xref>, <xref
                    href="denoise_non_local_means"><i>denoising based on non-local
                    means</i></xref> is probably the most convenient, as it allows you to treat
                color and luminance noise separately. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="basic_development_steps_spots">
            <title>Fixing spots</title>
            <p> Sometimes you will need to remove spots caused by sensor dirt. The <xref
                    href="spot_removal"><i>spot removal</i></xref> module and the <xref
                    href="retouch"><i>retouch</i></xref> module are at hand and can also correct
                other disturbing elements like skin blemishes. If your camera has stuck pixels or
                tends to produce hot pixels at high ISO values or longer exposure times, have a look
                at the <xref href="hotpixels"><i>hot pixels</i></xref> module for automatic
                correction. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="basic_development_steps_geometry">
            <title>Geometrical corrections</title>
            <p> Quite frequently you want to only show part of the captured scene in your image,
                e.g. to take away some disturbing feature close to the frame. In other cases, the
                horizon in the image may need levelling, or there are perspective distortions. All
                this can be corrected with full manual control in the <xref
                    href="crop_and_rotate"><i>crop and rotate</i></xref> module. For a fully
                automatic correction of perspective distortions you may alternatively visit the
                    <xref href="perspective_correction"><i>perspective correction</i></xref>
                module. If you need to correct typical camera lens flaws like cushion distortion,
                transversal chromatic aberrations or vignetting, there is a <xref
                    href="lens_correction"><i>lens correction</i></xref> module. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="basic_development_steps_details">
            <title>Bringing back detail</title>
            <p> Digital raw images often contain more information than you can see at first sight.
                Especially in the shadows of an image, there are lots of hidden details. The <xref
                    href="shadows_and_highlights"><i>shadows and highlights</i></xref> module
                helps bring these details back into visible tonal values. Structural details in
                fully blown-out highlights, by nature of the digital sensor, can not be recovered.
                However, you can correct unfavorable color casts in these areas with the <xref
                    href="highlight_reconstruction"><i>highlight reconstruction</i></xref>
                module. Additionally the <xref href="color_reconstruction"><i>color
                        reconstruction</i></xref> module is able to fill overexposed areas with
                suitable colors based on their surroundings. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="basic_development_steps_tonality">
            <title>Adjusting tonal values</title>
            <p> Almost every workflow is likely to include adjusting the image's tonal range.
                darktable offers several alternative modules to take care of that. The most basic
                one is the <xref href="contrast_brightness_saturation"><i>contrast brightness
                        saturation</i></xref> module. In the <xref href="tone_curve"><i>tone
                        curve</i></xref> module, tonal values are adjusted by constructing a
                gradient curve. The <xref href="levels"><i>levels</i></xref> module offers a
                concise interface, with three markers in a histogram. In addition, there is a <xref
                    href="zone_system"><i>zone system</i></xref> module which allows control over
                tonal values by zones, inspired by the work of Ansel Adams. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="basic_development_steps_local_contrast">
            <title>Enhancing local contrast</title>
            <p> Local contrast enhancement can emphasize detail and clarity in your image. Carefully
                used, it can give your photograph the right pop. darktable offers several modules
                for this task. The <xref href="local_contrast"><i>local contrast</i></xref>
                module is easy to handle, with just a few parameters. A much more versatile, but
                also more complex, technique is offered by the <xref href="equalizer"
                        ><i>equalizer</i></xref> module. Have a look at its presets, to get a
                feeling for how it works. Equalizer is darktable's "Swiss Army Knife" for many
                adjustments where spatial dimension plays a role. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="basic_development_steps_colors">
            <title>Color adjustments</title>
            <p> darktable offers many modules for adjusting colors in an image. A very
                straightforward technique is implemented in the <xref href="color_correction"
                        ><i>color correction</i></xref> module. Use it to give an image an overall
                tint or to adjust overall color saturation. The <xref href="color_zones"><i>color
                        zones</i></xref> module offers a much finer control to adjust saturation, or
                lightness, and even hue, in user defined zones. darktable's <xref
                    href="tone_curve"><i>tone curve</i></xref> module&nbsp;&ndash; in addition to
                the classical adjustment of tonal values&nbsp;&ndash; gives you fine control over
                the colors in an image. Finally, if you intend to convert an image into black &amp;
                white, a good starting point, with an easy to use and intuitive user interface, is
                offered by the <xref href="monochrome"><i>monochrome</i></xref> module.
                Alternatively, you might consider using darktable's <xref href="channel_mixer"
                        ><i>channel mixer</i></xref>. </p>

        <section id="basic_development_steps_sharpening">
            <title>Sharpening</title>
            <p> If you start your workflow from a raw image, you will need to have your final output
                sharpened. The <xref href="sharpen"><i>sharpen</i></xref> module can do this with
                the classical USM (unsharp mask) approach, available in most image processing
                software. Another very versatile way to enhance edges in an image is offered by the
                    <xref href="highpass"><i>highpass</i></xref> module, in combination with
                darktable's rich set of blending operators. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="basic_development_steps_effects">
            <title>Artistic effects</title>
            <p> darktable comes with a rich set of artistic effect modules. To name just a few: with
                the <xref href="watermark"><i>watermark</i></xref> module you add an individual
                watermark to your image. The <xref href="grain"><i>grain</i></xref> module
                simulates the typical noise of classical analogue footage. Use the <xref
                    href="color_mapping"><i>color mapping</i></xref> module to transfer the look
                and feel of one color image onto another. darktable's <xref href="low_light"
                        ><i>low light</i></xref> module allows to simulate human vision to make
                lowlight pictures look closer to reality. The <xref href="graduated_density"
                        ><i>graduated density</i></xref> filter adds a neutral or colored gradient
                to your image for exposure and color correction. </p>
