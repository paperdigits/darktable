        <p> To begin with darktable, you first need to import images. The import module is in the
            left panel of the lighttable view (<xref href="import"/>). You can either import from
            the filesystem or, if darktable supports your camera model, directly from camera. </p>

            <p> When importing from disk, you can import either a single image or a folder.
                darktable will analyse its content, detect images that are already imported and only
                import new images. </p>

            <p> Connect your camera to your system. If your distribution tries to automount it,
                select the option to abort the mount operation. Otherwise the camera will be locked
                and not accessible from within darktable. If you don't see your camera in the import
                module, hit the <q>scan for devices</q> button. Your camera will then appear in the
                same module with additional choices: <i>import</i> and <i>tethering</i>. </p>
