    <title><tt>darktable</tt> binary</title>
    <body>
        <p> This binary starts darktable with its GUI and full functionality; it is the standard way
            of using darktable. </p>
        <p>
            <tt>darktable</tt> is called with the following command line parameters: </p>
        <codeblock>darktable [-d {all,cache,camctl,camsupport,control,dev,
               fswatch,input,lighttable,lua,masks,memory,nan,
               opencl,perf,pwstorage,print,sql}]
          [&lt;input file&gt;|&lt;image folder&gt;]
          [--version]
          [--disable-opencl]
          [--library &lt;library file&gt;]
          [--datadir &lt;data directory&gt;]
          [--moduledir &lt;module directory&gt;]
          [--tmpdir &lt;tmp directory&gt;]
          [--configdir &lt;user config directory&gt;]
          [--cachedir &lt;user cache directory&gt;]
          [--localedir &lt;locale directory&gt;]
          [--luacmd &lt;lua command&gt;]
          [--noiseprofiles &lt;noiseprofiles json file&gt;]
          [--conf &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;]</codeblock>
        <p> All parameters are optional; in most cases users will start darktable without any
            additional parameters in which case darktable uses suitable defaults. 
            
            <dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>-d</dt>
                    <dd> This option enables debug output to the terminal. There are several
                        subsystems of darktable and debugging of each of them can be activated
                        separately. You can use this option multiple times if you want debugging
                        output of more than one subsystem. </dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>&lt;input file&gt;|&lt;image folder&gt;</dt>
                    <dd> You may optionally supply the filename of an image or the name of a folder
                        containing image files. If a filename is given darktable starts in darkroom
                        view with that file opened. If a folder is given darktable starts in
                        lighttable view with the content of that folder as the current collection.
                    </dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>--version</dt>
                    <dd> This option causes darktable to print its version number, a copyright
                        notice, some other useful information, and then terminate. </dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>--disable-opencl</dt>
                    <dd> This option prevents darktable from initializing the OpenCL subsystem. Use
                        this option in case darktable crashes at startup due to a defective OpenCL
                        implementation. </dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>--library &lt;library file&gt;</dt>
                    <dd> darktable keeps image information in an sqlite database for fast access.
                        The default location of that database file is
                            <tt>$HOME/.config/darktable/library.db</tt>. You may give an alternative
                        location, e.g. if you want to do some experiments without compromising your
                        original library.db. If the database file does not exist, darktable creates
                        it for you. You may also give <tt>:memory:</tt> as a library file in which
                        case the database is kept in system memory and all changes are discarded
                        when darktable terminates. <p> Whenever darktable starts, it will lock the
                            library to the current user. It does this by writing the current process
                            identifier (PID) into a lock file <tt>&lt;library file&gt;.lock</tt>
                            next to the library specified. If darktable finds an existing lock file
                            for the library, it will terminate immediately. </p></dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>--datadir &lt;data directory&gt;</dt>
                    <dd> This option defines the directory where darktable finds its runtime data.
                        The default place depends on your installation. Typical places are
                            <tt>/opt/darktable/share/darktable/</tt> and
                            <tt>/usr/share/darktable/</tt>. </dd>

                    <dt>--moduledir &lt;module directory&gt;</dt>
                    <dd> darktable has a modular structure and organizes its modules as shared
                        libraries for loading at runtime. With this option you tell darktable where
                        to look for its shared libraries. The default place depends on your
                        installation; typical places are <tt>/opt/darktable/lib64/darktable/</tt>
                        and <tt>/usr/lib64/darktable/</tt>. </dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>--tmpdir &lt;tmp directory&gt;</dt>
                    <dd> The place where darktable stores its temporary files. If this option is not
                        supplied darktable uses the system default. </dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>--configdir &lt;config directory&gt;</dt>
                    <dd> This option defines the directory where darktable stores the user specific
                        configuration. The default place is <tt>$HOME/.config/darktable/</tt>. </dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>--cachedir &lt;cache directory&gt;</dt>
                    <dd> darktable keeps a cache of image thumbnails for fast image preview and of
                        precompiled OpenCL binaries for fast startup. By default the cache is
                        located in <tt>$HOME/.cache/darktable/</tt>. There may exist multiple
                        thumbnail caches in parallel, one for each library file. </dd>
                </dlentry>

                    <dd>
                        <p> The place where darktable finds its language specific text strings. The
                            default place depends on your installation. Typical places are
                                <tt>/opt/darktable/share/locale/</tt> and
                                <tt>/usr/share/locale/</tt>. </p>

                    <dd>
                        <p> A string containing lua commands to execute after lua initialization.
                            These commands will be run after your <tt>luarc</tt> file. </p>
                        <p> If lua is not compiled in, this option will be accepted but won't do
                            anything. </p>
                    </dd>

                        <p> The json file that contains the camera specific noise profiles. The
                            default location depends on your installation. Typical places are
                                <tt>/opt/darktable/share/darktable/noiseprofile.json</tt> and
                                <tt>/usr/share/darktable/noiseprofile.json</tt>. </p>

                    <dd>
                        <p> darktable supports a rich set of configuration parameters which the user
                            defines in <tt>darktablerc</tt>, darktable's configuration file in the
                            user config directory. You may temporarily overwrite individual settings
                            on the command line with this option, however, these settings will not
                            be stored in <tt>darktablerc</tt>. </p>
